                  I want a new gardening project that suits my space.

                  These are the qualities of my space: #{selected_spaces}, #{spaces_input}
                  And I want to get this out of my project: #{selected_benefits}
                  Take into account the climate here: #{location}

                  I need the following for the project you suggest:
                  Name.
                  Standfirst.
                  Difficulty - between 1-5. Has to be above 0.
                  Duration - in either days, weeks or months. Don't include word 'duration'.
                  Description - ~80 words. Mention the location (#{location}) here.
                  A broken down bulleted list of 1-7 items I would need, put a
                  '|' between each item.
                  An unordered list of the method - max 1000 words, no headings,
                  put a '|' between each step.
                  A fun fact about it - max 20 words.
                  A broken down bulleted list of 7 plants that are mentioned
                  for  my project, put a '|' between each plant and don't use
                  brackets.

                  When generating the above, generate response in British
                  English and assume I don't know terms like 'proper drainage',
                  'trellis' or 'mulch' and that I'd need an explanation of how
                  to do things like sow seeds in pots. Leave out all special
                  characters like #, *, /.

                  I need this to be generated as follows:
                  / your generated response for name
                  / your generated response for standfirst
                  / your generated response for difficulty
                  / your generated response for duration
                  / your generated response for description
                  / your generated response for items
                  / your generated response for method
                  / your generated response for fun fact
                  / your generated response for plants
                  / your generated response for garden centres
                  "
                  }]
    })
